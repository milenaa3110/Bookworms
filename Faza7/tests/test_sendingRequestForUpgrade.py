        # self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)

        # Optionally, you can also check the response content or perform further assertions
        # For example, you can assert that a success message is present in the response

        # Example assertion for success message
        # self.assertContains(response, "Upgrade request submitted successfully")

        # Alternatively, you can assert that the user's upgrade request status is updated in the database
        # For example, if there is a UserProfile model with an 'upgrade_requested' field, you can assert its value

        # Example assertion for UserProfile model
        # user_profile = UserProfile.objects.get(user=self.user)
        # self.assertTrue(user_profile.upgrade_requested)
